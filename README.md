# ACN Marketplace Finder

A user-friendly web application designed to search through the ACN Marketplace with dynamic column-based filtering.

## Features

- **Dynamic Column Filtering**: Click on the magnifying glass icon in the table header to reveal a search box for that specific column.
- **Clear Search**: If a column has an active search filter, the magnifying glass icon turns into an "X" icon. Clicking on this icon will clear the search filter for that column.
- **Combined Filtering**: Apply filters on multiple columns simultaneously. The table will update to show rows that match all applied filters.
